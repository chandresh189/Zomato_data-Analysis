### About Our Project 🍲
India is quite famous for its diverse multi cuisine available in a large number of restaurants and hotel resorts, which is reminiscent of unity in diversity. Restaurant business in India is always evolving. More Indians are warming up to the idea of eating restaurant food whether by dining outside or getting food delivered. The growing number of restaurants in every state of India has been a motivation to inspect the data to get some insights, interesting facts and figures about the Indian food industry in each city. So, this project focuses on analysing the Zomato restaurant data for each city in India.

The Project focuses on Customers and Company, we have analyzed the data and made some useful conclusion in the form of Visualizations. The data is vizualized as it becomes easy to analyse data at instant. The Analysis also solve some of the business cases that can directly help the customers finding the Best restaurant in their locality and for the company to grow up and work on the fields they are currently lagging in.
